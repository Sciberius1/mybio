# Project Name

## Description

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my creative skills. I do not feel comfortable claiming to be a technical writer when I technically haven't written anything. Degree's require you to cite five other people's work instead of creating your own thoughts. I am not a fan of that. I am a fan of creating my own thoughts and ideas, creating my own work. Sadly, I can only draw stick figures so I have to use stories and AI to express my creativity. Let me know what you think of my work. I am always looking to improve.

## Usage

These are my creative writing projects. I am always looking to improve. Let me know what you think. If you wish to you them please let me know. I am willing to discuss it. Any usage without my permission is strictly prohibited, unless you're a student in a class and then you can fall back on the American Psychotic Association citation regulations say I can use it to form a thought or prove my own thoughts matter. - have fun been there done that.
